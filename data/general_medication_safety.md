# General Medication Safety for Patients

This document provides general safety information about taking medicines. It is **not** a substitute for advice from your doctor, pharmacist, or other qualified health professional.

## Key Principles

- Always follow the instructions on the label and from your clinician.
- Never start, stop, or change the dose of a prescription medicine without talking to your prescriber.
- Keep a current list of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.
- Store medicines in a cool, dry place, out of reach of children and pets.

## Before Taking a New Medicine

Before you start a new medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist:

- What is this medicine for?
- How and when should I take it?
- What side effects should I watch for?
- Are there any foods, drinks, or other medicines I should avoid?

If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, tell your clinician before starting any new medicine.

## Missed or Extra Doses

If you miss a dose, read the patient instructions that came with your medicine or call your pharmacist. Do **not** double up doses unless a clinician tells you to.

If you accidentally take more than the prescribed dose, contact your local poison control center or seek urgent medical advice.

## When to Seek Urgent Help

Call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency department if you:

- Have trouble breathing or swelling of your face, lips, or tongue
- Feel severe chest pain or pressure
- Notice sudden confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking
- Think you may have taken a dangerous overdose
