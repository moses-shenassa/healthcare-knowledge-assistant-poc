# High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Patient Education

High blood pressure, or hypertension, means the pressure of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. Over time, this can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.

This document is for education only and does **not** replace guidance from your clinician.

## What is Blood Pressure?

Blood pressure is usually written as two numbers:

- **Systolic** (top number): pressure when the heart beats
- **Diastolic** (bottom number): pressure when the heart rests between beats

Your clinician will tell you what range is appropriate for you.

## Possible Symptoms

Many people with high blood pressure have **no symptoms**. That is why hypertension is sometimes called a "silent" condition.

Severe or very high blood pressure can cause:

- Headache
- Blurry vision
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath

These symptoms can also be signs of other serious conditions. Seek urgent care if they occur suddenly or severely.

## General Lifestyle Measures

Lifestyle changes can help support healthy blood pressure:

- Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Reducing sodium (salt) intake
- Staying physically active most days of the week
- Maintaining a weight that is appropriate for your body
- Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding tobacco

Do **not** change or stop prescribed blood pressure medications without talking to your clinician.

## Monitoring and Follow-up

Your clinician may recommend:

- Regular blood pressure checks at home or in the clinic
- Periodic lab tests or other assessments
- Follow-up appointments to review your treatment plan

Always follow your clinician's advice and ask questions if anything is unclear.
