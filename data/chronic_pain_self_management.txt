Chronic pain is pain that lasts for months or longer and may continue even after an injury or illness has healed. This document offers general self-management ideas and does not replace medical or mental health care.

1. Understanding Chronic Pain
   - Chronic pain can be influenced by physical, emotional, and social factors.
   - It is real, even when the cause is not easily seen on tests or scans.
   - A care team may include doctors, physical therapists, and mental health professionals.

2. Activity and Movement
   - Gentle, regular movement can help many people with chronic pain.
   - Pace yourself: avoid doing too much on “good days” and too little on “bad days.”
   - Ask your clinician or physical therapist about exercises that are safe for you.

3. Sleep and Rest
   - Try to keep a regular sleep schedule.
   - Use a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading or relaxation techniques.
   - Avoid large meals, caffeine, and screens close to bedtime when possible.

4. Stress Management and Emotional Health
   - Chronic pain can affect mood, and mood can affect pain.
   - Techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness, or gentle stretching may help some people.
   - Talking with a counselor, psychologist, or support group can provide tools for coping.

5. Medications and Treatments
   - Some people use medications, physical therapy, injections, or other treatments as part of their plan.
   - Never start, stop, or change a medication without guidance from your clinician.
   - Ask questions about side effects and what to expect.

6. When to Seek Additional Help
   - If pain suddenly worsens or changes in a new way, contact your clinician.
   - If you feel hopeless, overwhelmed, or have thoughts of self-harm, seek urgent mental health support or emergency care.
