# When to Seek Emergency Medical Care

This guide offers general information about situations that usually require **immediate** medical attention. It is not exhaustive, and it is not a substitute for professional medical judgment.

If you are ever unsure, it is safer to seek help promptly.

## Call Emergency Services or Go to the Emergency Department If You Have:

- Chest pain or pressure that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath at rest
- Sudden weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking, especially on one side of the body
- Sudden loss of vision or severe, unexplained headache
- Fainting, collapse, or feeling like you might pass out
- Serious injury such as a deep wound, head trauma, or uncontrolled bleeding
- Thoughts of harming yourself or others

## Children and Emergencies

Seek urgent care for a child who:

- Has difficulty breathing, grunting, or blue lips
- Is difficult to wake up or unusually drowsy
- Has a seizure for the first time
- Has a stiff neck with fever and a severe headache
- Has signs of severe dehydration (no tears when crying, very dry mouth, no urination for 8 hours or more)

## Mental Health Crises

If you or someone you know is thinking about self-harm or suicide, this is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency number or a crisis hotline right away.

## Important Reminder

This document is for information only and cannot cover every situation. When in doubt, seek care sooner rather than later. A qualified clinician can help you decide what level of care is appropriate.
