Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition that affects how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). This document focuses on general lifestyle measures that can support health for people living with type 2 diabetes. It is not a substitute for medical advice.

Key lifestyle areas include:

1. Healthy Eating
   - Emphasize vegetables, lean proteins, and high-fiber foods.

   - Try to eat regular meals and snacks to help keep blood sugar stable.
   - Work with a dietitian or diabetes educator when possible.

2. Physical Activity
   - Aim for regular physical activity most days of the week, such as walking, cycling, or swimming.
   - Start slowly and increase gradually, especially if you have been inactive.
   - Ask your clinician what kinds of activity are safe for you.

3. Blood Sugar Monitoring
   - Some people may check their blood sugar at home using a meter or continuous glucose monitor.
   - Follow the monitoring plan recommended by your diabetes care team.
   - Write down your readings if asked, and bring them to your appointments.

4. Foot Care
   - Check your feet daily for blisters, cuts, redness, or sores.
   - Keep feet clean and moisturized, but avoid lotion between the toes.
   - Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes.
