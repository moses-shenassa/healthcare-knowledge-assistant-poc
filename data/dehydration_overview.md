# Patient Guide: Understanding Dehydration

Dehydration happens when your body loses more fluid than it takes in. It can range from mild to severe and can affect people of all ages.

This guide offers general education and is **not** a diagnosis or treatment plan.

## Common Causes

- Not drinking enough fluids, especially in hot weather
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Fever and sweating
- Certain medications that increase urination

## Early Signs and Symptoms

Mild to moderate dehydration may cause:

- Thirst
- Dry mouth or lips
- Dark yellow urine or urinating less often
- Headache
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Tiredness or feeling weak

## Signs of More Serious Dehydration

Seek medical attention promptly if you notice:

- Very dark or amber-colored urine, or not urinating at all for 8 hours or more
- Rapid heartbeat or breathing
- Sunken eyes
- Confusion, irritability, or feeling unusually drowsy
- In infants: no tears when crying, very dry mouth, or significantly fewer wet diapers

## General Self-Care Tips

For mild dehydration:

- Sip water or an oral rehydration solution slowly and regularly.
- Avoid sugary drinks or large amounts of caffeine.
- Rest in a cool, shaded environment.

If symptoms do not improve, or if you have other medical conditions such as heart or kidney disease, contact your clinician for personalized advice.
