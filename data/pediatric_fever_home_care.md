# Caring for a Child with Fever at Home

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature and is often a sign that the body is fighting an infection. This guide offers general information for caregivers and does not replace advice from your child's clinician.

## What is a Fever?

In many children, a rectal, ear, or temporal artery temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher is considered a fever. Always follow your clinician's instructions on how to measure temperature.

## When a Fever May Be Managed at Home

Many mild illnesses with fever can be managed at home if your child:

- Is drinking fluids and making normal amounts of urine
- Is alert and able to interact, even if less active than usual
- Has no difficulty breathing
- Has no severe pain

General comfort measures:

- Offer plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
- Dress the child in light clothing.
- Use fever-reducing medicine only if recommended by your clinician and follow dosing instructions carefully.

## When to Contact a Clinician

Contact your child's clinician promptly if:

- Your child is younger than 3 months and has a fever
- The fever lasts more than 2–3 days
- Your child appears unusually irritable, drowsy, or confused
- The fever is accompanied by ear pain, sore throat, or pain when urinating

## When to Seek Emergency Care

Seek emergency medical care for a child with fever who has:

- Trouble breathing, noisy breathing, or blue lips
- A seizure
- A stiff neck with severe headache
- Signs of severe dehydration (no tears, very dry mouth, no urine for 8 hours or more)
- A rash that spreads quickly or looks like small dark or purple spots

This information is general and may not apply to every child. Always follow the advice of your child's clinician.
